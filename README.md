# Consuming Covid-19 Statistics API 
The COVID-19 data API provides Coronavirus statistics updated every 15 minutes.
I used this API to demonstrate how to make GET requests and converting a JSON object into a simple Java data object in SpringBoot REST application, or as developers more frequently referred to them, plain old Java objects (POJOs). I use two COVID-19 data API endpoints, getTotals and GetCountryData. The getTotals endpoint returns worldwide statistics while the getCountryData returns totals limited to an individual country. 
Both endpoints are HTTP GET requests.
